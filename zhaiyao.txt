	 	An Improved Iris Region Localization Method in Eye Image for Iris Recognition
	The application of iris recognition technology has become a research focus for the high degree of uniqueness and anti-counterfeit of the iris image. However,in practical application,the iris recognition technology still has many defects,such as iris image interference ,low-quality iris positioning and the improper selection of iris feature and other factors. Since iris localization is the first step of iris recognition,so the pros and cons of the iris localization is the assurance to achieve efficient and reliable identity authentication. Because of the importance of iris localization,so in this article,we focus on the shortage parts in existing iris localization technology,and proposed an improved iris localization technique. Firstly, the images are preprocessed;secondly the center of pupil coarse positioned through template convolution operation by a Gaussian template;then,according to the integral and differential positioning based on the statistical knowledge of outer circle of iris and pupil localization algorithm to realize precise localization of pupil and the inner edge of iris;finally ,according to the ‘rubber ball’ model proposed by doctor John Daugman to precise localization of the center of pupil and the outer edge of iris. This article is to verify the validity of the improved algorithm so that it tests the CASIA iris databases and analyzes the results . Experiment results show that this method not only could significantly reducethe location time,but also achieve 98. 82% of location precise rate,which with practical application value.
